## Dynamic Programming Problems  
The **Dynamic Programming** topic is key to solving optimization and decision-making problems. These problems will enhance your ability to break down complex problems into smaller subproblems and solve them efficiently.

### Problems:  
1. **Climbing Stairs to Reach the Top**  
   Find the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of a staircase with `n` steps, where you can take 1 or 2 steps at a time.  
2. **Coin Change (Minimum Coins)**  
   Given a set of coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount.  
3. **Longest Increasing Subsequence**  
   Find the length of the longest subsequence in an array where elements are in increasing order.  
4. **Longest Common Subsequence**  
   Determine the longest subsequence common to two given strings.  
5. **Word Break**  
   Check if a given string can be segmented into valid dictionary words.  
6. **Combination Sum**  
   Find all unique combinations of numbers that sum to a target, allowing repetition of elements.  
7. **Stickler Thief**  
   Find the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in an array (house robber problem).  
8. **Stickler Thief II**  
   Solve the same problem as Stickler Thief but for a circular array of houses.  
9. **Total Decoding Messages**  
   Given a numeric string, count the number of ways it can be decoded using letter mappings (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).  
10. **Grid Unique Paths**  
    Calculate the number of unique paths from the top-left to the bottom-right of a grid, moving only down or right.  
11. **Jump Game**  
    Determine if you can reach the last index of an array starting from the first index, given maximum jump lengths.

### Approach  
- Understand the problem statement and identify if it can be broken down into overlapping subproblems.  
- Start by solving the problem using recursion, and then optimize it with memoization or tabulation.  
- Focus on the time and space complexity of your solutions.  
- Gradually move to more complex problems as you gain confidence.
