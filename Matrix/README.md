## Matrix Problems  
The **Matrix** topic focuses on problems involving 2D arrays and matrix manipulations. These problems will help you develop skills in traversing, modifying, and querying matrices efficiently.

### Problems:  
1. **Set Matrix Zeroes**  
   Modify a matrix so that if an element is `0`, the entire row and column containing that element are set to `0`.  
2. **Spirally Traversing a Matrix**  
   Traverse a matrix in a spiral order (starting from the top-left and moving right, down, left, and up repeatedly).  
3. **Rotate Matrix**  
   Rotate a matrix by 90 degrees in place (clockwise or counterclockwise).  
4. **Word Search**  
   Given a 2D board of characters and a word, check if the word exists in the board by moving horizontally or vertically.  

### Approach  
- Pay attention to matrix bounds and edge cases like empty matrices or non-square matrices.  
- For problems involving traversal, consider strategies like "layer-by-layer" or "four pointers" to handle the spiral traversal.  
- For problems like "Set Matrix Zeroes" and "Rotate Matrix," focus on space optimization (try to solve in-place whenever possible).  
- Be mindful of time complexity when working with large matrices.
