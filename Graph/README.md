## Graph Problems  
The **Graph** topic covers problems involving traversal, connectivity, and structural properties of graphs. These problems will help you master algorithms like BFS, DFS, and topological sorting, which are crucial for graph-related problem-solving.

### Problems:  
1. **Clone an Undirected Graph**  
   Create a deep copy of an undirected graph, preserving the structure and connections.  
2. **Course Schedule**  
   Determine if itâ€™s possible to complete all courses given their prerequisites (cycle detection in a directed graph).  
3. **Pacific Atlantic Water Flow**  
   Find all cells in a matrix where water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.  
4. **Number of Islands**  
   Count the number of islands in a 2D grid where `1` represents land and `0` represents water.  
5. **Longest Consecutive Subsequence**  
   Find the longest sequence of consecutive elements in an array, which can be interpreted as a graph problem.  
6. **Alien Dictionary**  
   Determine the order of characters in an alien language, given a sorted dictionary of words (topological sorting).  
7. **Graph is Tree or Not**  
   Check whether a given graph is a valid tree (connected and acyclic).  
8. **Connected Components in an Undirected Graph**  
   Count the number of connected components in an undirected graph.  

### Approach  
- For each problem, choose the appropriate graph representation: adjacency list, adjacency matrix, or edge list.  
- Master traversal algorithms like BFS and DFS for exploring graphs.  
- Learn advanced techniques such as cycle detection, topological sorting, and union-find.  
- Analyze time and space complexities, especially for large graphs.
