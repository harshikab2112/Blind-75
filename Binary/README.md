## Binary Problems  
The **Binary** topic focuses on problems that utilize binary representations and bit manipulation techniques. These problems will help you understand how to efficiently solve problems involving bits and binary operations.

### Problems:  
1. **Sum of Two Numbers Without Using Arithmetic Operators**  
   Add two integers without using `+` or `-` operators by leveraging bit manipulation.  
2. **Number of 1 Bits**  
   Count the number of `1`s (set bits) in the binary representation of an integer.  
3. **Counting Bits**  
   For every number in the range `[0, n]`, calculate the number of `1` bits in its binary representation.  
4. **Missing in Array**  
   Find the missing number in a given array of integers where the elements range from `0` to `n`.  
5. **Reverse Bits**  
   Reverse the binary representation of a given 32-bit unsigned integer.  

### Approach  
- For each problem, learn the key bit manipulation techniques such as AND, OR, XOR, shifts, and masks.  
- Understand edge cases like handling large integers or 32-bit constraints.  
- Aim for optimal solutions with minimal time and space complexity.
