## String Problems  
The **String** topic involves problems related to string manipulation, pattern matching, and optimization. Mastering these problems will help you efficiently solve real-world text-processing tasks.

### Problems:  
1. **Longest Distinct Characters in String**  
   Find the length of the longest substring with distinct characters in a given string.  
2. **Longest Repeating Character Replacement**  
   Replace the least frequent characters in a string to make all characters the same and return the longest possible length of the substring.  
3. **Smallest Window in a String Containing All the Characters of Another String**  
   Find the smallest substring of a given string that contains all the characters of another string.  
4. **Anagram**  
   Check if two given strings are anagrams of each other.  
5. **Parenthesis Checker**  
   Check if the parentheses in a given string are balanced (e.g., `()` or `[]`).  
6. **Palindrome Sentence**  
   Determine if a sentence is a palindrome, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case.  
7. **Longest Palindromic Substring**  
   Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.  
8. **Palindromic Substrings**  
   Count the total number of palindromic substrings in a given string.  
9. **Encode and Decode Strings**  
   Design a method to encode a list of strings into a single string and decode it back into the list of strings.

### Approach  
- Use sliding window and two-pointer techniques for substring problems, especially for finding distinct characters or repeating characters.  
- Understand how to efficiently check for palindromes using dynamic programming or expand-around-center techniques.  
- Focus on time complexity when handling large strings, especially in problems like "Smallest Window" and "Anagram."  
- For encoding/decoding, think about how to handle delimiters to avoid ambiguity.
