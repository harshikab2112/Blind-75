## Tree Problems  
The **Tree** topic covers fundamental problems involving tree data structures, including binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and tries. These problems will help you strengthen your ability to navigate and manipulate hierarchical structures.

### Problems:  
1. **Height of Binary Tree**  
   Find the height (or depth) of a binary tree.  
2. **Identical Trees**  
   Check if two binary trees are identical (structurally and value-wise).  
3. **Mirror Tree**  
   Check if one binary tree is the mirror of another (reflection symmetry).  
4. **Maximum Path Sum From Any Node**  
   Find the maximum sum of a path in a binary tree where the path can start and end at any node.  
5. **Level Order Traversal**  
   Perform a breadth-first traversal of a binary tree, returning the nodes level by level.  
6. **Serialize and Deserialize a Binary Tree**  
   Convert a binary tree into a string representation (serialization) and reconstruct the tree (deserialization).  
7. **Check If Subtree**  
   Check if one binary tree is a subtree of another.  
8. **Construct Tree from Inorder & Preorder**  
   Construct a binary tree from its inorder and preorder traversal sequences.  
9. **Check for BST**  
   Check if a given binary tree is a binary search tree (BST).  
10. **Kth Smallest Element in BST**  
    Find the `K`-th smallest element in a binary search tree.  
11. **Lowest Common Ancestor in a BST**  
    Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary search tree.  
12. **Insert and Search in a Trie**  
    Implement a trie (prefix tree) with insert and search operations.  
13. **Add and Search Word**  
    Implement a trie with `add` and `search` methods for searching entire words or prefix matches.  
14. **Word Search II**  
    Solve the problem of finding all words from a given list in a 2D board of characters using a trie.

### Approach  
- Focus on recursive solutions, especially for tree traversal, subtree checking, and path finding.  
- Use BFS or DFS for level order traversal and other breadth-first or depth-first operations.  
- Learn about tree construction techniques, such as building from inorder and preorder traversals.  
- Master the properties of BSTs (inorder traversal, search, and LCA) to solve problems efficiently.  
- Understand how to use tries for prefix-based search problems.
