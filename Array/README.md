## Array Problems  
The **Array** topic covers essential problems involving searching, sorting, and manipulation of arrays. These problems will help you build a strong understanding of foundational array-based algorithms.  

### Problems:  
1. **Two Sum**  
   Find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target.  
2. **Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Max One Transaction Allowed**  
   Find the maximum profit you can achieve by buying and selling a stock once.  
3. **Check if Array Contains Duplicates**  
   Determine if there are any duplicate elements in the array.  
4. **Product Array Puzzle**  
   Construct an array such that each element is the product of all the elements except itself without using division.  
5. **Maximum Subarray Sum**  
   Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum (Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm).  
6. **Maximum Product Subarray**  
   Determine the contiguous subarray within an array that has the maximum product.  
7. **Minimum in Sorted and Rotated Array**  
   Find the smallest element in a sorted and rotated array.  
8. **Search in Sorted and Rotated Array**  
   Search for a target value in a sorted and rotated array.  
9. **Find All Triplets With Given Sum**  
   Identify all unique triplets in the array that add up to a specific target.  
10. **Container With Most Water**  
    Given an array of heights, find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

### Approach  
- Start solving these problems in the given order.  
- For each problem, understand the problem statement, constraints, and inputs/outputs clearly.  
- Implement solutions and analyze their time and space complexity.  
- Revisit problems periodically to reinforce your learning and improve your coding speed.
