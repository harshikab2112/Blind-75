## Linked List Problems  
The **Linked List** topic involves problems that test your understanding of pointer manipulation and the ability to traverse and modify linked lists. These problems are crucial for mastering data structure fundamentals.

### Problems:  
1. **Reverse a Linked List**  
   Reverse a singly linked list in-place.  
2. **Detect Loop in Linked List**  
   Check if a linked list contains a cycle and, if so, find the starting node of the cycle.  
3. **Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists**  
   Merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.  
4. **Merge K Sorted Linked Lists**  
   Merge `K` sorted linked lists into one sorted list efficiently using a priority queue or divide and conquer.  
5. **Kth from End of Linked List**  
   Find the `K`-th node from the end of a linked list in one traversal.  
6. **Reorder List**  
   Reorder a linked list by rearranging its nodes to alternate between the first and last elements.  

### Approach  
- Use pointers (slow, fast, and additional helpers) for traversal and manipulation.  
- Master recursive and iterative techniques for solving linked list problems.  
- Focus on edge cases, such as empty lists, single-node lists, and lists with cycles.  
- Optimize solutions for time and space complexity, especially for merging and traversal problems.
